          ## The Problem

          Keeping a portfolio up to date means editing HTML across multiple pages,
          wrestling with layouts, and re-deploying for every small change.

          ## The Solution

          One YAML file. Edit your content, run the CLI, and your entire site rebuilds.

          **Key Features:**
          - Install via npm: `npm install -g devfolio-page`
          - All content lives in a single, readable YAML file
          - Change a project description, add a skill, update your bio — one file, whole site
          - Multiple themes: SRCL terminal aesthetic, modern minimalism, dark academia
          - Live dev server with auto-rebuild for fast iteration
          - Generates lightweight static HTML/CSS/JS for Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages

          ## The Problem

          Writers struggle to find beta readers and connect with literary agents.
          The query process is fragmented and opaque.

          **For Agencies:** Agency pages, agent management dashboards, invite system

          **For Agents:** Customizable query letter wizards, wishlist profiles, query management dashboard

          **For Writers:** Agent matching system, manuscript upload, query tracking with status updates

          **For Beta Readers:** Apply to read manuscripts, in-app annotation tools, reputation/rating system

          Smart genre matching and analytics tie everything together.
